# Wrangle_and_analyze_data
## About the Project
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. 
I documented my wrangling efforts in the attached Jupyter Notebook. I also showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
The dataset I wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates).

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates peoples' dogs with a humorous comment about dogs. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.
The numerators are almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. 

WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
WeRateDogs [downloaded their Twitter archive](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160) and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for the use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

## Wrangle Act
